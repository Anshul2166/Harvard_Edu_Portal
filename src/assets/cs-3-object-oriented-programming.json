    overview:[" primary goal is for you to learn to appreciate and use the fundamental design principles of modularity and abstraction in a variety of contexts from electrical engineering and computer science. To achieve this goal, we will study electrical engineering (EE) and computer science (CS) largely from the perspective of how to build systems that interact with, and attempt to control, an external environment."],
