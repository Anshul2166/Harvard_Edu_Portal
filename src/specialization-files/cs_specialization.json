  overview: [
    " This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice",
    " No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview.",
    " To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs.",
    " Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time â€” you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are!",
    " It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming",
    " The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly.",
    " You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine."

    overview: [
      " If you want to break into AI, this Specialization will help you do so. Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in tech. We will help you become good at Deep Learning.",
      " In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more",
      " You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow, which we will teach.",
      " You will also hear from many top leaders in Deep Learning, who will share with you their personal stories and give you career advice.",
      " AI is transforming multiple industries. After finishing this specialization, you will likely find creative ways to apply it to your work.",
      " We will help you master Deep Learning, understand how to apply it, and build a career in AI."
