### Abstract

Technology is growing by leaps and bounds throughout the world, and with the advent of new
technologies almost every moment and the simultaneous outdating and updating of the existing
technologies, many working professionals and students find it difficult in keeping themselves
continuously relevant in the ever-changing and demanding job market, which also leads to increased
unemployment and job dropouts. This also presents a peculiar problem since even with high
unemployment reported, there are also reports of several vacancies going unfilled, and now in the
digital age, with online learning gaining foothold and acceptance everywhere, some may find it hard to
acknowledge the simultaneous existence of both. Our project tries to solve this particular problem by
trying to bridge the gap between both paradoxical situations and present an adaptive,
community-driven, skill-based approach to empower the students and working professionals alike to
face the dynamic and complex sounding job market .
